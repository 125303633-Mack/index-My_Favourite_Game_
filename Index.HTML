<p><center>I've had one specific favourite game of mine for a very long time, ever since i was around the age of 9 or 10. That game is <b>Halo 3.</b></center><p>

<p><br><center> I spent an ungodly amount of time playing this game by myself, with my brothers / cousins / friends all over my estate growing up. I was introduced to it by one of my older brothers friends when he brought it over to our house. Up until then I had only ever really played nintendo games on the WII console. This was the first "grown up" game I ever got my hands on. I think its still as fun to play now as it was back then. It being my favourite is definitely influenced by a massive amount of nostalgia.</center><p>
